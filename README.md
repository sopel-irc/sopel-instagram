# sopel-instagram

A Sopel plugin to fetch information about Instagram links.

## Current status

We are looking for prospective plugin maintainers! Most of Sopel's built-in
plugins will be moved out of core within the next few releases. When the
`instagram` plugin's turn comes, it will need someone to take charge of
keeping it working.

If that sounds like you, get in touch in `#sopel` on freenode, or open an issue.
